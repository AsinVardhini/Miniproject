## Title of the Project
Iot Enabled Self-operating Therapy for Immobile Patient Using Arm Gripper
## About
The abstract discusses a concept of an IoT-enabled smart hand gripper that helps patients, such as paralytic patients, in performing hand movements associated with daily activities. In paralysis patients, most common effect is loss of motor functions; patients will often manifest an inability to pick, hold, or manipulate any object, and afterwards rely further on assistance from others, resulting in a loss of independence.

This novel gripper combines the functionality of a typical hand gripper with that of an IoT device so its grip force and information can be wirelessly shared with other devices. It has a system of force reproduction where electrodes combined with sensors measure the grip strength of the user, then adjusts the power level of the gripper based on that.

The device allows patients to be independent in performing the activities, thus improving their quality of life. It can be worn during surgery, and real-time feedback is provided to users and caregivers. It is scalable and cost-effective in order that the device may be used by a large number of paralysis and related disorder patients for more independence in daily life.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Offers real-time data tracking and remote monitoring capabilities, allowing healthcare providers to track usage, diagnose issues, and adjust settings from a distance.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
The outcomes and impact of the IoT-enabled prosthetic arm gripper will be significant since it will empower patients with paralysis to obtain functional independence in the performance of everyday activities. Adaptive grip control, real-time integration of IoT, and real-time monitoring enable users to perform a variety of hand movements with ease and thereby improve the quality of life users are living. Embedded sensors and haptic feedback enrich the experience to become natural and responsive, making the grip more precise for the user with confidence. On one hand, remote monitoring and diagnostics provide continuous support, thereby allowing healthcare providers to monitor the progression of a patient or a patient population and make time-critical changes in response. In aggregate, the device reduces dependence on support, aids self-reliance, and facilitates user satisfaction through functionality and personalization.
